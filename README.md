Ace.Tern
========

Tern plugin for Ace Editor


Project Status
============

 - INCOMPLETE  *but functional*
 - Code is currently messy and contains a lot of debug logging that needs to be removed
 - There are quite a few known issues that I'm still working on
 - I've been coding this extension for use in the [Caret-T Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret-t/agiednhnlghobdgpgfdnbdaflnngmoij) first, then I copy changes to this repository (*This will change in the future*). Use this Chrome App to get the full Tern functionality and as a demo until I can get a chance to post a working demo online. 
 - For a quick demo of features, install the Caret-T Chrome App and paste the following code into the editor in Javascript mode: [Demo Javscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevin7676/Ace.Tern/master/DemoJavascript.js)
